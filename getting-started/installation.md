# Installation

To get a free Developer license of the program, register on our [website](https://myaccount.g1ant.com/MyAccount/Register). You will then receive an email with a link to the file download webpage, where you can choose from the standalone EXE or Windows MSI Installer file, either in a full or lite version \(with or without add-ons\).

To run the program on a system start-up, paste the shortcut to the executable file in the Windows Startup folder.

To navigate to Windows Startup folder:

1. Hold down the **Windows** key and press **R**.
2. Type: `shell:startup`.
3. Click **OK**.

Now G1ANT.Robot is set to initialize automatically on a system start-up. When G1ANT.Robot is running in the background, press **Ctrl+G** to choose a selected process or click on the **G** icon in the system tray to bring the robot window to the foreground.
