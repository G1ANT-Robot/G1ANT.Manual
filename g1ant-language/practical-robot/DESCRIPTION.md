# Practical Robot: Real-Life Scenarios

One of the most typical examples of robotization on PCs is automating daily tasks, which are done in desktop apps. MS Office applications, for instance, have their own automation engine — Visual Basic macros — to help users change repetitive actions into code in the easiest possible way: by recording their activities in Word or Excel. This recorded actions can then be tweaked and edited in Visual Basic Editor.

It’s a nice feature and lots of people use MS Office macros and VB scripts to ease their everyday chore, but when you want to do something outside of Microsoft’s behemoth suite, say, transfer some data from external sources such as a PDF attachment in an email client, into your Excel spreadsheet, you are left empty-handed.

Well, you would be, if you were forced to rely solely on Microsoft’s solution. Fortunately, G1ANT.Robot is here to the rescue. We will show you how to use it effectively with your common desktop apps, MS Office included, and teach you some G1ANT.Language commands along the way.
