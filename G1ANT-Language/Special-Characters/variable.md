# variable

Section `variable` defines script variables with global range.
Each entry of this section should be defined as below:

`variable = value`

where `variable` is variable name and `value` describes its value.
The same principles apply during declaring variable value as it works in the G1ANT scripts.



**Example 1:**

In this example a variable `pi` is set to `3.14` in G1ANT.Robot.ini file. Then we start G1ANT.Robot and using `dialog` command initialized variable is displayed.
