# G1ANT.Robot Documentation

Welcome to the open source [documentation](https://manual.g1ant.com) of [G1ANT.Robot](https://www.g1ant.com/). Please review this README file to understand how you can assist in contributing to the G1ANT.Robot documentation.

## Getting Started

Contributing to open source is more than just providing updates, it's also letting us know when there is an issue. You can submit issues with the standard [Issues](https://help.github.com/articles/about-issues/) tab on GitHub.

### Prerequisites

Contributing to the documentation requires a GitHub account and some [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) knowledge.

### Conventions

Folders are treated as sections of the Manual: chapters, sub-chapters and so on. If a section needs an introductory page, e.g. with its contents description, a DESCRIPTION.md file containing such text should be placed in that sectionâ€™s folder. For example, the opening page for Auxiliary Windows section in G1ANT.Robot Window chapter is in [this description file](../g1ant.robot-window/auxiliary-windows/DESCRIPTION.md) located in `auxiliary-windows` folder.

We use [headers](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/#examples) in Markdown files to allow navigation in the final Manual structure.

All media objects (pictures, videos and so on) should be placed in [-assets](../-assets/) folder, and links to them in .md files should be relative, for example `../-assets/picture.jpg`.
