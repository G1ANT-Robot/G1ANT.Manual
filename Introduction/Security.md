# Security

Here at G1ANT, we treat IT Security and Data Protection at the highest priority. To ensure full security of our clients, G1ANT.Robot has the following procedures implemented:

* G1ANT.Robot is limited to Standard User Account and Privileges â€” whatever the user \(machine/workstation\) is permitted to do, G1ANT is only restricted to those privileges
* The Robot has Credential Container built in, which stores fully encrypted passwords in case the Robot is required to access any systems or websites secured with log in procedure
* G1ANT.Robot does not require to store or send any data
* Scripts saved in binary format can be password protected
* G1ANT is subject to the Windows Privacy Policy and the Microsoft Firewall
* In case there is a power failure or any other situation that may disrupt the processes, we provide specially programmed triggers, which ensure that any unfinished task shall be re-triggered.

Every step of any performed task is reported with status data, therefore developers can program the system to be transactional and to be able to perform specified rollback operations.
