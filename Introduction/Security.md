# Security

At G1ANT, we treat IT Security and Data Protection at highest priority. To ensure full security to our clients, G1ANT.Robot implemented the following procedures:

a.	G1ANT.Robot is limited to Standard User Account and Privileges – whatever the user (machine/workstation) is permitted to do, G1ANT is only restricted to those privileges

b.	The Robot has built in Credentials Container, which stores fully encrypted passwords if Robot is required to access any systems or websites requiring log in details

c.	Encrypted communication between Robots and Dashboard

d.	Fully encrypted Robot’s Script Files – to ensure that the process/robots running in production are not disturbed in any way by unauthorised users

e.	G1ANT Robot does not require to store or send any data

f.	G1ANT is subject to the Windows Privacy Policy and the Microsoft Firewall

In case there is a power failure or any other situation that may disrupt the processes, we provide specially programmed triggers, which ensure, that any unfinished task shall be re-triggered.

Any performed task reports status data at every step, therefore developers can program the system to be transactional and to be able to perform specified rollback operations.
