# Hosting

G1ANT.Robot has the ability to run on Physical and/or Virtual Machines. It usually resides on client’s servers, Virtual Machines or individual employees’ PCs \(to support human assisted automations\).

G1ANT.Robot scripts are stored in text or binary files, locally or on a server.

Although we do not offer hosting on our servers, we can assist you in setting up servers on Windows Azure or Amazon Cloud.
