# Including C\# Macros

GIANT.Robot allows to include C\# macros within automated process. Whether there is a need to perform special actions with variables or simply a requirement for some custom feature that is not supported by our software, simply insert a C\# macro into the process. To do this choose `Macro/⊂⊃ Insert` from the menu, click `⊂⊃` icon on the toolbar or press **Ctrl+9**.

Any C\# procedure to be compiled and executed can be attached within G1ANT.Robot.

## About C\#

C\# is designed to work with Microsoft’s .NET robot. Microsoft’s aim is to facilitate the exchange of information and services over the Web, and to enable developers build highly portable applications.

C\# simplifies programming through its use of Extensible Markup Language \(XML\) and Simple Object Access Protocol \(SOAP\) which allow access to a programming object or method without requiring developers to write additional code for each step. Because programmers can build on existing code, rather than repeatedly duplicating it, C\# is expected to make it faster and less expensive to get new products and services to the market.
