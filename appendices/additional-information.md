# Additional Information

#### **Robot’s location**

The robot \(its script\) is stored in plain text or binary files, locally or on the Server. ****

#### **Deployment**

Deployment can be both local and central, as requested.

#### **G1ANT & Big Data**

For Big Data processing, G1ANT uses external AI software, such as IBM Watson, connecting them via API. We can also connect with any other API, thanks to our RESTprotocol.

#### **Assisted Automation**

The G1ANT.Robot can interact with its user on many levels. For example, the user has to authorize Robot’s actions by pressing the enter key, and sometimes the robot generates dialog windows, which have to be closed by the user as well, before the robot can proceed.
