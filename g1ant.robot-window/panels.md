# Panels

Panels are parts of G1ANT.Robot window, which display available program resources \(commands, variables, help content etc.\), so that you can easily see and pick them for your robot script.

You can enable displaying panels by choosing their names from `View` menu \(Addons, Commands, Logs, Special Variables, Structures, Symbols and Variables panels\) or from `Help` menu \(Help and Learning panels\). One of the panels, Interactive, is accessible from `Debug` menu, since it is for debugging purposes only.

The panels are movable — but not floating — and you can dock them anywhere around the G1ANT.Robot script window. They also have the option to auto hide: just click the pin icon in the top right corner of the panel, beside the X \(close\) icon.
