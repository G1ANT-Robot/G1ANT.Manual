# Toolbar

G1ANT.Robot's toolbar is pretty simple and self-explanatory:

![](../-assets/new.jpg) Creates new empty robot script

![](../-assets/open.jpg) Opens a robot file

![](../-assets/save.jpg) Saves current robot script to a file

![](../-assets/undo.jpg) Undo last action

![](../-assets/redo.jpg) Redo last action

![](../-assets/run.jpg) Run the current script

![](../-assets/stop.jpg) Stop the running script

![](../assets/help.jpg) Display Help

The remaining icons represent special characters used in G1ANT.Language for quick and easy inserting them into your robot script
